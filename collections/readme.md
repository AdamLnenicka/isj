This script defines a decorator called `log_and_count` designed to wrap other functions. When applied to a function, `log_and_count` logs each invocation of the function and keeps track of how many times it has been called.

Here's how it works:

1. **Decorator Arguments**: `log_and_count` takes two optional arguments: `key` and `counts`. `key` allows specifying a custom identifier for the function being decorated, while `counts` is expected to be a dictionary-like object to store the invocation counts.

2. **Inner Functions**: Inside `log_and_count`, there are two inner functions: `inner1` and `inner2`. These form a closure, allowing them to access the variables defined in the outer scope.

3. **Function Wrapping**: 
   - `inner1` is a wrapper function that takes the target function (`func`) as an argument.
   - `inner2` is the actual wrapper that logs the function call, updates the count for the corresponding key, and then calls the target function with the provided arguments.

4. **Usage**:
   - The `@log_and_count` decorator is applied to three functions: `f1`, `f2`, and `f3`, with optional arguments specifying the `key` and `counts`.
   - Each time a decorated function is called, its name or the specified `key` is used to update the corresponding count in the `counts` object.

5. **Counter Object**: The counts are stored in a `Counter` object named `my_counter`, which is initialized at the beginning of the script.

6. **Error Handling**: There's a provision to handle cases where the `counts` argument is not provided. If `counts` is `None`, it's initialized to an empty dictionary to prevent errors when trying to update its values.

With this setup, you can easily monitor the invocation counts of the decorated functions and customize the behavior by providing custom keys or count storage objects.
