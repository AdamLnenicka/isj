The `Polynomial` class in this script represents polynomials and provides various operations on them. Here's a summary of its attributes and methods:

- **Attributes**:
  - `polynom`: A dictionary representing the polynomial terms, where the keys are the exponents and the values are the coefficients.

- **Methods**:
  - `__init__`: Initializes a polynomial object. It accepts either positional arguments (coefficients) or keyword arguments (`x` followed by the exponent) to define the polynomial.
  - `__str__`: Returns the string representation of the polynomial.
  - `__eq__`: Checks if two polynomials are equal.
  - `__add__`: Adds two polynomials.
  - `__pow__`: Raises the polynomial to a given power.
  - `derivative`: Computes the derivative of the polynomial.
  - `at_value`: Computes the value of the polynomial at a given value of `x`, or the difference between the values at two given `x` values.

The `test()` function contains several test cases to verify the correctness of the `Polynomial` class methods, covering scenarios such as polynomial initialization, addition, exponentiation, differentiation, and evaluation at specific values of `x`.

The tests ensure that the class methods handle various cases correctly, such as polynomials with different representations, addition of polynomials, exponentiation, differentiation, and evaluation at specific `x` values.
